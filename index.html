                <p class='flow-text'>Not MY fault this is happening. Morty! The principal and I have discussed it,
                    a-a-and we're both
                    insecure enough
                    to agree to a three-way! Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick! Ooh, your
                    little flappy
                    doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your
                    buddies
                    found a grape?

                    I wish that shotgun was my penis. Looks like some sort of legally safe knockoff of an '80s horror
                    character
                    with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives! Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to
                    do was to
                    hand me a screwdriver, Morty! And that's the wayyy, the news goes!

                    Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die. Whoa, spoilers! I'm a whole season behind. The fucking
                    amish bitch
                    shot me! Ohh yea, you gotta get schwifty.

                    It probably has space aids. Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! Ooohhh can do.
                    It's a
                    dream, Morty! We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and
                    crapped your
                    pants, we-we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside
                    Snuffles' dream.

                    You know my name, that's disarming. You're talking about Inception? Meeseeks were not born into
                    this world
                    fumbling for meaning, Jerry! Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The
                    payoff is huge.

                    These 2 halves don't belong together, bitch! Your failures are your own, old man! I say, follow
                    throooough! I
                    dunno, some people would pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough. Burgertime!

                    The fucking amish bitch shot me! Wow, so your origin is what? You fell into a vat of redundancy?
                    Are these
                    pills supposed to wake me up or something? Snuffles was my slave name. You can call me Snowball,
                    because my fur
                    is pretty and white.

                    Puh rum pum pow! Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers Who Are Just Regular
                    Brothers Running In
                    A Van From An Asteroid And All Sorts Of Things: The Movie. Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack. It's
                    fine,
                    everythings is fine. theres an infinite number of realities Morty, and in a few dozens of those i
                    got lucky and
                    turned everything back to normal.

                    Because I don't respect therapy; because I'm a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and
                    destroy for
                    a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to
                    a rented
                    office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which
                    feelings has ever
                    helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking,
                    which is a
                    state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow,
                    I'm a
                    pickle... when I feel like it. I mixed in some praying mantis DNA. You know a praying mantis is the
                    exact
                    opposite of a vole, Morty? They mate once and then bluergh cut each other's heads off. "And"? What
                    more do you
                    want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?" Cause he roped
                    me into
                    this!

                    Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me? Are you hungry for apples? ARE YOU HUNGRY FOR
                    APPLESSS!?
                    Rubber baby buggy bumpers! God-damn!

                    Wow, so your origin is what? You fell into a vat of redundancy? Well he roped me into this! Who
                    cares, Morty?
                    Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before—I'm a
                    pickle! I'm
                    Pickle Ri-i-i-ick! Thanks Noob Noob, this guy gets it.

                    I'm not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe? It's not like we can
                    do this
                    every week, we get 3 or 4 more of these tops. I just killed my family! I don’t care who they were!
                    It's like
                    the N word and the C word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews.

                    You can run, but you can't hide bitch! Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand
                    me a
                    screwdriver, Morty! Mind your own goddamn business, Gene! I'm having a conversation with my mother
                    here!
                    Kissing Rick's ass isn't gonna make him stay, Mom, but it will help you lose everyone else. I just
                    killed my
                    family! I don’t care who they were!

                    Isn't it obvious Morty? I froze him. Hi! I'm Mr Meeseeks! Look at me! They'll just fall right out
                    of my ass!
                    I've done this too many times! Haha god-damn!

                    This is Principal Vagina. No relation. I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into
                    my life,
                    and you want to, grab him and, stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?!
                    Snuffles want
                    to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood. It's a device Morty, that when you put it in your
                    ear, you
                    can enter people's dreams Morty. Its just like that movie that you keep crowing about.

                    Don't even trip about your pants, dawg. We got an extra pair right here. Puh rum pum pow! You ask
                    alotta
                    questions Morty, not very charismatic of you. Grassss... Taste bad!

                    We don't whitewash it either, Morty. I mean, the pirates are really rapey. That's Right Morty! This
                    is gonna be
                    a lot like that. Except you know. It's gonna make sense. Why'd you even rope me into this?! Yeah,
                    well, tough
                    titties.

                    I don't like it here Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what
                    to do. I
                    consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt? And that's the wayyy,
                    the news goes!
                    Jesus Christ! Did the boomy-booms blow up all your wordy-word books? We will return… possibly in
                    different
                    clothing.

                    I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality you're as dumb as they come. Awww, bitch! Why are you
                    doing this
                    bit? We're gonna die. Looks like some sort of legally safe knockoff of an '80s horror character
                    with miniature
                    swords for fingers instead of knives!

                    Ooohhh can do. Right, Crocubot. So, you're half cold unfeeling reptile, half also cold equally
                    unfeeling
                    machine? What are you looking at, mother fucker! God? God's turning people into insect monsters
                    Beth. I'm the
                    one beating them to death. Thank me</p>
